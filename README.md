# Farger.inc
*Farger* is the plural form of the Norwegian word *farge* that means color.

This is an extended set of POV-Ray include files with, at the moment, **6568** named color definitions. In the master file, [farger.inc](./farger.inc), you can comment out the include-files you don't need.

It is mostly based on the **Wikipedia** list of colors that you can find at: [*Lists of colors*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors) in addition to [*Encycolorpedia*](https://encycolorpedia.com/named).

In addition, there are separate include files for colors from:

- [*Crayola crayon colors*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Crayola_crayon_colors)
- [*X11 color names*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_color_names) and [*Web named colors*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors)
- [*LEGOâ„¢ colors*](http://www.peeron.com/cgi-bin/invcgis/colorguide.cgi)
- [*Xona.com color list*](http://xona.com/misc/colorlist/)
- [*RAL Classic *](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_RAL_colors#Overview)
- [*Aerospace Material Specification Standard 595 (AMS STANDARD 595 COLOR)*](http://www.federalstandardcolor.com/)_(This is an USA government color standard)_.
- *Farger_PC.inc* - This is an extended include file with color definitions from a trademarked and proprietary color space system. It is based on the list of colors found on a webpage that now has disappeared; the owner of that brand/trademark is known for _vigourlysly_ defending it, so I will probably remove this file in a later version.

## Simple documentation
In the [_Documentation_](./Documentation/) folder, you will find a set of HTML-files (one for each of the include-files) that contain a simple table showing the color name, the RGB hex color code and a button that will copy the color name to the clipboard.
